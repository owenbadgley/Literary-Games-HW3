Hi! This is how im submitting the reflection because I don't know how to add a google doc on canvas :) I hope you found it!

Most of the time I spent on this project was trying to remember how to use git. I had used it for a class before, but I 
forgot almost all of it in the time in between now and that class. Oh well. Now, though, I know it much better than I ever did
before. I've become a bit of a command line wizard as you put it in class. That was what I struggled with, and didn't really 
have fun with, but I know it now. So that's good. The most fun I had was looking through itch.io for fun little sprites.

I found this assignment to be enjoyable, but I don't think that I made a game. In Galloway's little chart analysis, this would
firmly sit in the machinic half of the chart. I suppose it would also sit in the diegetic quadrant, because everything in the
game is a part of the "game world," in as loose of a way as that term can be used. That calls into question whether or not a 
"game" must take part in all of these quadrants. I think that it does have to, because otherwise it's just a video, without 
the game part. Even if the operator interaction is minimal, and has almost no impact on how the game progresses, it has to be
there to qualify something as a game. Does this make turning the pages of a book operator interaction, you may ask? I would 
say no. I think the operator interaction has to have some impact, or require some thought. Otherwise it is a visual novel.

This leads me quite nicely into my quick little discussion about Device 6. I didn't finish the game, because I had found the 
puzzles in chapter 2 and 3 to be tedious, so I stopped playing after that. The story had not grabbed me at all at that point 
either. After class, though, I feel like I should have kept playing. The twist at the end seemed very interesting to experience
Device 6 also has something very interesting to say about not the machanic, but the diegetic. If you wrap the player into the 
experience, is everything then diegetic? I suppose it is, because the story technically encompasses the entire world. My cats
are diegetic in the world of device 6. All in all, I like galloway's interpretation quite a bit, although I agree with the 
point made in class that it leaves no room for the developers. Death of the author is something we're talking about in one
of my other classes, and I personally feel like the author has an impact on how I view something. I'm going to listen to any
new Kanye song much differently now than I would have about two years ago. I think the author is important, and Galloway 
dismisses them too easily.
